## About
Heroes Of The Universe is a social platform where fans of Tabletop Roleplaying Games like Dungeons & Dragons are able to create their own characters within the page and share them with other users. The main goal for this app is to offer a page to share the heroes played during the user's adventures and view what other heroes may be present in a different universe, each unique and special for all people.

## User Experience Design
### Strategy
The app is designed to be easy to use and intuitive for anyone that would like to use the platform, not only people that play Dungeons & Dragons. The main goal of the app is to offer a place to share your characters and heroes with other people and comment about their adventures. This has been achieved by the use of a simple and intuitive interface. As a final goal, the app is aimed at increasing the interaction in the Dungeons & Dragons community.
### Target Audience
The app was developed for all people that would like to share and view characters created by the users for their own adventures playing Dungeons & Dragons. The main target audience is, of course, people that play Tabletop Roleplaying games on a regular basis, but anyone can freely create their own characters and share their ideas and adventures.
### User stories
I started out by creating a Google Document as a draft for my user stories. Some of these do not reflect the final user stories, as their are part of the draft. If interested, you can find the Google Document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HGU-_M8eFG6tbEmyOQRU3fcUhpdaqVkLYOh1duqaIM/edit?usp=sharing).
